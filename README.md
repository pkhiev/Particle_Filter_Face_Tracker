# Particle_Filter_Face_Tracker
Computer vision face tracking. A face tracker was implemented using a Haar Cascade Classifier for initial face detection and a particle filter algorithm for tracking the movement of the face throughout a video stream.

Please see [Particle_Filter_Face_tracker.pdf] for more information.
