# Particle_Filter_Face_Tracker
Computer vision face tracking. A face tracker was implemented using a Haar Cascade Classifier for initial face detection and a particle filter algorithm for tracking the movement of the face throughout a video stream. Currently, the code functions and briefly detects and tracks face movement before crashing. Debugging is needed to rectify crashing issue
